# Image-Processing-using-Python
A simple demonstration of handling images with python
## pip install PIL 
After importing this module you can perform n number of funtions I've tried to show the most common in this repo.

I've commented the important you need to follow and also a sample example of flipping the image using this same code.
 NOTE:
 You need to set path of the images and specify the same in your python code.
